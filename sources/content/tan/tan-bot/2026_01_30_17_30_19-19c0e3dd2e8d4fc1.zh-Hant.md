Dear Colleagues,

We are pleased to announce that the JCMT Users Meeting 2026 will be
held at *the
Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) in** Taipei,
Taiwan, from **June 8 to 11, 202*6.

The meeting will consist of:

   - June 8–10: Scientific and technical sessions
   - June 11: Lectures and hands-on tutorials for new JCMT users

As in previous years, the final day (June 11) will also be available
for satellite
meetings organized by user groups, such as JCMT Large Program teams. More
details of the meeting can be found here:
https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20260608/index.php

The scientific and technical sessions will highlight recent results
obtained with the JCMT, including those related to VLBI/EHT. We will also
discuss ongoing and upcoming technical developments—such as a next
generation continuum camera, HARP, and dual-band VLBI—along with their
potential scientific applications. Additionally, the meeting will explore
synergies between JCMT and other facilities, including ALMA, existing and
future large millimeter/submillimeter telescopes like AtLAST and LST, and
multiwavelength facilities.

If you are interested in participating, please mark your calendars. Further
details will be provided in the second circular.

We look forward to seeing you in Taipei!
