Dear astronomers

Happy New Year.

TARA will have a town hall session during the
TPS meeting next week, from 13:00 to
14:30 for 90 minutes.  There will be short
presentations on the projects of ALMA, GMT, and
the 2-m telescope, leaving sufficient time for
questions and discussions.

Please do come.

Cheers,
Wen Ping
