Dear Colleagues,

We are pleased to announce that the *CHiP International Gravitational Wave
Summer School* will be held again this summer. Following the success of the
Winter School held in February 2025, which brought together students from
around the world interested in gravitational wave science, we are excited
to continue this initiative.

Report on the Winter School
<https://ncusec.ncu.edu.tw/news/en/headlines_content.php?H_ID=4421>

With continued support from the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, this 12-day
training camp will offer hands-on experience in *interferometer control and
optical systems* — essential techniques for the commissioning of detectors
such as KAGRA and LIGO. The event will take place at *National Central
University (NCU)*, where participants will have access to a tabletop
interferometer and a digital control system synchronized with the latest
LIGO software suite.
