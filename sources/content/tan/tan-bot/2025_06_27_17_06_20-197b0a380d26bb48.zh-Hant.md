CL2025: Entering a Golden Age of Galaxy Cluster Studies
The First East Asian Workshop on Galaxy Clusters

September 23-26, 2025
Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica (ASIAA), Taipei, Taiwan

https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20250923/index.php


*** Scientific rationale

With the rich datasets delivered by ongoing and upcoming large-scale
imaging and spectroscopic surveys such as Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam
(HSC) survey, Dark Energy Survey, Kilo-Degree Survey, Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST), Euclid, Roman, Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI), Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS), eROSITA,
South Pole Telescope, Atacama Cosmology Telescope/Simons Observatory,
CMB-S4, we are entering a golden age for studying all aspects of
galaxy clusters -- from cosmological constraints, rise and fall of
star formation activities of cluster galaxies, physics of intracluster
medium, role of cosmic filaments in cluster formation, to properties
of dark matter, only to name a few.

The primary purpose of this new series of workshops is to gather
researchers from all over the world -- with an emphasis on East Asian
regions -- to share the latest findings, discuss novel approaches, and
form new collaborations. The first installment will be held at the
Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica (ASIAA) in
Taipei, Taiwan, on 9/23-26/2025. During the 4-day workshop, we will
have high-quality invited and contributed talks, poster presentations,
3 hour-long discussion sessions, and a half-day free time for further
interactions. All the talks in the workshop will be in person,
although we might be able to broadcast the talks in real time.

The topics to be covered include (but not limited to):
* Star formation and AGN activities in clusters and groups
* Gas inflows and outflows and feedback
* Roles of cosmic filaments and groups on properties of gas and galaxies
* Quenching of galaxies and their dependencies on mass and environment
* Mass assembly of clusters and the formation of BCGs and ICL
* Circum-galactic medium of galaxies in clusters/groups
* Hot side of clusters
* Custer mass estimates and scaling relations
* Dark matter properties
* Status of ongoing surveys and prospects of future projects

We plan to hold the workshop series in Taiwan, Japan, and Korea every 1-2 years.
