Dear all,


For the recently approved
<https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/news/detail/fwf-funds-three-new-special-research-areas>
 Austrian Science Fund (FWF) Special Research Area (SFB) “Dark UNiverse
Explorations – DUNE” we are looking to hire PhD candidates and Postdocs at
the University of Innsbruck, the University of Vienna, and the Institute
for Science and Technology Austria (ISTA).DUNE creates a new Austrian
research network studying cosmology, galaxy formation and evolution, and
the nature of the Dark Universe. Embedded into large international
collaborations, such as the *Euclid Consortium <https://www.euclid-ec.org/>*
 and *COLIBRE <https://colibre.strw.leidenuniv.nl/>*, the interdisciplinary
DUNE team will probe the nature of the dominant invisible components of the
Universe, dark matter and dark energy, by analysing *Euclid* and JWST
observations and combining them with state-of-the-art simulations.For
the *University
of Innsbruck*, we invite applications for *four PhD positions* in
extragalactic astrophysics and observational cosmology, *one postdoctoral
researcher position* on high-redshift Euclid weak lensing , and *one
administrative part-time position*, all with an application deadline on
January 18, 2026. To learn more about these positions and the application
process see: *https://www.uibk.ac.at/en/astro/staff/open-positions/
<https://www.uibk.ac.at/en/astro/staff/open-positions/>*The *University of
Vienna* invites applications for *three DUNE-related PhD positions* in the
field of cosmological simulations (deadline Jan 11):
