Dear all,

We are pleased to announce the workshop on "Multiwavelength Studies of Supernovae, Kilonovae, and Gamma-Ray Bursts", which will be held on April 15, 2026, at National Central University (NCU).

The motivation of this workshop is to bring together researchers working on explosive transients to discuss recent progress and future prospects in multiwavelength observations using both space-based and ground-based facilities. The workshop is also motivated by the visit of the Czech QUVIK (Quick Ultra-Violet Kilonovae Surveyor) team to Taiwan, providing a valuable opportunity for discussion on time-domain transient science.

The workshop will feature invited talks covering a broad range of topics related to supernovae, kilonovae, and gamma-ray bursts, with an emphasis on observational results and upcoming facilities. Everyone is very welcome to join.

The details (including registration) can be found on the workshop website:

Best regards,
Yen-Chen
