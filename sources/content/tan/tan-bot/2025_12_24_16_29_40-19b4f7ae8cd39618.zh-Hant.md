Dear all,

Please find below a reminder of registration for the PFS/HSC-AGN
conference at ASIAA in March 2026 from the SOC.

As explained in the "Scientific Rationale" on the front page of the
web, this conference will cover a wide range of AGN-related
extragalactic studies. While the main focus will be on the Subaru PFS
and HSC studies, we welcome researchers working on non-Subaru
(including ongoing and future missions/projects), multi-wavelength,
and theoretical studies. We encourage many of you to present your own
results in any relevant field and/or to find opportunities to interact
with AGN researchers around the PFS/HSC at the conference.

From the Scientific Rationale:
The topics to be covered in the conference include (but are not limited to):
AGN search with multi-wavelength/time-domain data
Statistical properties of AGN/galaxies (e.g., luminosity function and
correlation function)
SMBH growth over cosmic time
AGN host properties (e.g., morphology and AGN-SF connection)
AGN/galaxy environment
Any PFS-related topics
Status of on-going AGN/galaxy projects and future prospects
