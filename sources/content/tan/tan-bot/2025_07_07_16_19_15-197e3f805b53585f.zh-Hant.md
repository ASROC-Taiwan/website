Dear colleagues,

We are pleased to announce the upcoming workshop:

"Reconstructing the Universe: Synergies between Galaxy Surveys, Lensing, and Simulations"
üìÖ December 15‚Äì18, 2025
üìç Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA), Taipei, Taiwan
üåê Workshop Website <https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20251215/index.php>
This workshop will bring together researchers working at the intersection of theory, simulations, and observations to discuss new methods and challenges in extracting cosmological information from large-scale structure‚Äîparticularly focusing on field-level inferences and reconstruction techniques for initial conditions and baryon acoustic oscillations. We aim to foster collaboration across survey boundaries and disciplines.

Key topics include:

Reconstruction of the initial conditions and large-scale structure

Synergies between galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and spectroscopic data

Field-level inferences and simulation-based forward modeling

Challenges in data analysis pipelines for upcoming surveys (e.g., LSST, Euclid, Roman, DESI, PFS)
