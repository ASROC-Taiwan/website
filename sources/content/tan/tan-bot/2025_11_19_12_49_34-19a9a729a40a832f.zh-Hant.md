The IAA website shows that Patrick will be giving a talk on Nov 25. Is it

You're encouraged to chat with them and attend their talks. To arrange
meetings, you can contact me, Sienny (for Patrick Hennebelle), or Shami
(for James Owen, Eve Lee). For the first few visitors, I plan to organize a
speaker dinner on 12/4.

Cheers,
