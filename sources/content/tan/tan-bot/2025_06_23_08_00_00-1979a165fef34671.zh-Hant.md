Dear colleagues,

After some unforeseen constraints, this planet formation meeting is now
confirmed to be held in Kunming, China. The good news is that Kunming is
much easier to get to than the previous venue. Registration is open:

I encourage you to submit an abstract to give a talk. You can also present
a poster, in which case you can just bring it without submitting an
abstract.

This follows an unofficial series of conferences, dating back to 2017 in
Shanghai, 2019 in Japan/Taiwan, and most recently in Beijing 2023
<https://epf2023.github.io/>.

Cheers,
Min-Kai
