Dear colleagues,

We will have our monthly NCTS Astrophysics Student Lunch Seminars next *Friday,
11/28*, from 12pm in the 4F lecture room in the Cosmology Hall. Talk
details are appended below. You can sign up for lunch boxes here:

Please come and support our students.

Cheers,

*Probing the Magnetic Field Structure of the Protoplanetary Disk in HD
163296*
Yu-Xuan Nancy Lin (NYCU, supervisor: Shih-Ping Lai)

Magnetic fields are expected to play an important role in the evolution of
protoplanetary disks, yet their structure remains difficult to measure. In
this work, we investigate the magnetic field morphology of the HD 163296
disk using archival ALMA 870 μm polarization data. Although polarization is
often attributed to magnetically aligned dust grains, recent studies
indicate that dust self-scattering can produce comparable or even dominant
polarization signals. To separate these mechanisms, we apply two
approaches: (1) assuming a uniform self-scattering polarization angle and
subtracting its contribution from the observed Stokes parameters, and (2)
modeling disk density and temperature structures and simulating
self-scattering with RADMC-3D. The residual polarization is then
interpreted as tracing the magnetic field. Our results show that
self-scattering dominates the observed polarization, while the magnetic
contribution is weak and difficult to isolate. These findings underscore
the challenges of using dust polarization to probe disk magnetic fields and
motivate future studies with improved modeling and broader source samples.
