Dear colleagues,

The NCTS Astrophysics group is resuming our monthly student seminar series.
These provide opportunities for our domestic students to share their work
and practice giving live talks. The schedule for the rest of the year is
appended below. Seminars begin at 12pm in the 4F lecture room in the
Cosmology Hall on the NTU campus. Talks are open to all.

Sign up links for lunch boxes will become available from the NCTS seminar
list a week before the talks:

Cheers,
Min-Kai
