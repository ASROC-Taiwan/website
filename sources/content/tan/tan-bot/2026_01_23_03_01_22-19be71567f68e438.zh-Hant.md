Dear All,

We would like to invite you to the Time-Domain Astronomy Hands-on Workshop:
Spectroscopy, Real-time Alerts, and Multi-wavelength Integration, to be
held at National Central University (NCU) on March 2–3. This is a
practical, hands-on workshop focusing on end-to-end follow-up workflows and
data reduction, aimed at graduate students, postdocs, and early-career
researchers interested in time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy.

Highlights (hands-on focused):
* Spectroscopic data reduction and best practices (including PyPeIt
long-slit hands-on)
* From real-time alerts to follow-up observations (GCN / TNS / WISeREP /
ATel workflows)
* Swift/UVOT/XRT practical session and multi-wavelength data integration
* Case studies and exercises (e.g., FORS2 / X-Shooter)

Special Speaker:
Dr. Steve Schulze (Weizmann Institute of Science)

Date & Venue:
* March 2–3
* NCU, Chien-Shiung Building (Science Building IV)
