Dear Colleagues,

This is to announce the opening of Call for Proposals for the LOT semester
2025C from 1 Sep 2025 to 31 Dec 2025. Attached are the announcement with
more details and the Latex templates for the proposal.

The submission deadline is 31 July 2025 at 23:59 (local time in Taiwan).
Kindly send your proposal(s) as one PDF file, including the proposal
compiled PDF file and an additional one-page section for Figures and/or
Tables, with the subject "LOT 2025C proposal" to me by email. Please let me
know if you have any questions.

Please note that for educational programmes, LATTE offers up to three
runs/groups this semester. It is required that the PI (or a designated TA)
is already familiar with how to operate LATTE prior to the observations.

Thank you for your collaboration!

Best regards,
Janet Chen (NCU) on behalf of LOT TAC
