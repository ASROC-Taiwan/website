Dear all,

As a part of the NCTS-TCA Summer Student Program (SSP), a mini-workshop will be held on July 1 - July 3 
to introduce students to the basic knowledge as well as frontier research developments in selected topics in 
astrophysics. There will be 1 talk in the morning and 2 talks in the afternoon on each day (see attached poster for the 
schedule). The workshop will be held in hybrid format.

Note that this workshop is open to all interested students (not only to the summer students). Since the SSP is aiming 
for undergraduate students, all talks will be at an introductory level.

All interested students are encouraged to register by 6/15 (Sun) for the mini-workshop via the following website:

https://nctstca.github.io/events/202507-tcassp/workshop.html

Please feel free to help forward this information. We look forward to your participation!

Best regards,
NCTS-TCA SSP 2025 Organizing Committee
