Dear all,


Apologies for the multiple emails you may have received from the new TAN (Taiwan Astronomy Network) mailing list.

Following the retirement of the previous TAN server, ASROC has taken over management of the mailing list, which now serves as a platform for sharing astronomy-related announcements in Taiwan, including conferences, workshops, schools, and job opportunities.

Currently, all faculty members are set as “managers” by default. Only managers can post messages to the mailing list (tan@asroc.org.tw).


If you prefer not to be listed as a manager, please contact us at: service@asroc.org.tw.

If you wish to unsubscribe from the mailing list, you may click the “Leave group” button at: https://groups.google.com.


Best regards,
Kuo-Chuan Pan
on behalf of ASROC
