The Taiwan Astronomy Network (TAN) was initially operated and maintained by Professor Kuan Yi-Jehng from the Department of Earth Sciences at National Taiwan Normal University. Over the years, it has served as an important communication platform for the Taiwanese astronomy community through email and web announcements, earning recognition and support from the academic community.

On May 29, 2025, the management of TAN was transferred to the Astronomical Society of the Republic of China (ASROC), where it is now managed and maintained under unified oversight. In June of the same year, TAN was further integrated into the official website of ASROC (currently under testing), becoming one of the society’s key information dissemination platforms. It continues to serve the national astronomy community, enhancing the flow of academic information and resource sharing. Through TAN, researchers, teachers, and students can quickly access the latest domestic and international astronomy talks, summer schools, and academic activities, thereby promoting knowledge exchange and collaboration.
