Simulations consistently suggest that such interactions significantly reshape the distribution of molecular gas within galactic disks, thereby altering the spatial distribution of star formation. In this study, we aim to observationally investigate the distribution of gas and star formation across different merger stages and assess the extent to which these observations align with simulation predictions. Here we analyze a sample of 15 galaxies—including galaxy pairs and post-mergers—with stellar masses log(M*) ≥ 10 [M⊙] and redshifts in the range 0.02 \u0026lt; z \u0026lt; 0.1, using data from ALMA and SDSS-MaNGA. We also construct radial profiles of gas fraction, star formation rate(SFR), and star formation efficiency(SFE), extending from the galactic center to 1.5 effective radii(Re). Our results indicate that the gas fraction is the primary driver of elevated SFR in close pair systems. Nevertheless, all merger stages exhibit an inconsistent relationship between SFR and gas mass, suggesting the presence of a common regulatory mechanism governing star formation during galaxy interactions.\nOn Mon, Jul 14, 2025 at 11:41 AM Min-Kai Lin mklin@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw wrote:\nDear colleagues,\nThe NCTS Astrophysics group is resuming our monthly student seminar series.

These systems form within dense, dusty clouds, where high extinction presents a significant challenge for direct observational studies of the physical and chemical processes at the onset of star and planet formation. Over the past decades, most studies have relied on submillimeter and millimeter interferometric observations \u0026mdash; primarily using ALMA \u0026mdash; to probe the cold dust and gas (~10–100 K), helping to constrain the structures and chemistry of planet-forming disks. More recently, the JWST has enabled unprecedented sensitivity at mid-infrared wavelengths, allowing us to characterize hot gas and dust (\u0026gt;1000 K). However, the bulk of the energy emitted by protostars and protoplanetary disks lies in the far-infrared regime (100–1000 K) \u0026mdash; a spectral window that was once accessible through missions such as ISO, AKARI, SOFIA, and Herschel, but is no longer covered by current observatories. The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) is a proposed mission designed to uniquely fill this observational gap.\nPRIMA aims to probe the dominant components of gas and dust in star-forming regions, with a particular focus on protostellar and protoplanetary systems. In this talk, I will introduce the PRIMA mission concept and the efforts currently led by the Japanese astronomical community. I will also present several key science cases in star formation that PRIMA’s 24–235 μm imaging and spectroscopic capabilities can uniquely address. Additionally, I will highlight the synergy between PRIMA and the LST. Finally, I will share opportunities for researchers to get involved in the PRIMA project and contribute to its scientific goals.\nZoom Link https://us06web.zoom.us/j/86216241378?pwd=fQ1eMhhQVofVS0OKQ1W8DdysmNUiZl.1 Organizers Chian-Chou CHEN (ASIAA, Taiwan), Ray S.

Although open star clusters have been studied for more than a century, the high accuracy of Gaia mission opens a new window on these objects, discovering a large number of new open clusters as well as facilitating much better comparison with numerical models than previously possible. Shortly after their formation, massive stars terminate the star formation event by expelling the star forming gas. The rapid movement of the gaseous mass often has a strong impact on the dynamics of stars in the cluster. After gas expulsion, the cluster evolves mainly due to energy equipartition, mass segregation, stellar evaporation and ejection as well as the tidal field imposed by the Galaxy. From these dynamical processes, we will pay particular attention on two topics: gas expulsion, and dynamical evolution of orbital parameters of binary stars as they encounter other cluster members with emphasis on stars of spectral type B and Cepheids. We will discuss the properties of tidal tails forming around open star clusters as the consequence of early gas expulsion as well as of dynamical evaporation. We also suggest that the typical configuration for B star formation is likely in hierarchical triples, not binary stars as usually assumed.\n\u0026ndash; Yueh-Ning Lee Associate Professor, Department of Earth Sciences, National Taiwan Normal University https://www.es.ntnu.edu.tw/index.php/en/index_en/ Deputy Director, Center of Astronomy and Gravitation https://www.cag.ntnu.edu.tw/index.php/en/main/ Tel: +886-2-7749-6417 李悅寧 國立台灣師範大學 地球科學系 副教授 天文與重力中心 副主任\n","date":"4 July 2025","permalink":"/website/en/tan/tan-bot/2025_07_04_16_59_39-197d4aa3499e5dbb/","section":"Taiwan Astronomy Network","summary":"","title":"CAG/NTNU seminar 10/Jul/2025 12:20 S801"},{"content":"Dear colleagues,\nThis is a reminder of the EANAM10 meeting in Jeju Island:\nhttps://coma.kasi.re.kr/eanam10/\nThe registration deadline is July 31.

The previous meeting, EAMA10, was held in 2016, with subsequent gatherings postponed partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. EAMA11, the upcoming gathering hosted by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), will broaden its scope to encompass astronomical researchers across Asia and beyond, providing a valuable platform for researchers to reconnect, share ideas, and promote collaboration. We solicit talks on regional activities, current and upcoming large-scale facilities, recent scientific discoveries, astronomy education and public outreach. We encourage regional researchers to actively participate, build lasting friendships, and develop future collaborative projects.\nMEETING TOPICS: Regional Activities Projects and Instrumentation Cosmology and Galaxy Formation Supermassive Blackholes and Active Galactic Nuclei Diffuse Interstellar Medium Star Formation and Exoplanets Astrophysics of Sun and Stars High Energy Astrophysics Multi-Messenger and Time-domain Astronomy Outreach and Education\nConfirmed Invited Speakers Geoff Bower (EAO) Ken Chen (ASIAA) Mamoru Doi (NAOJ) Lei Hao (SHAO) Daniel Harsono (NTHU) Paul Ho (EAO) Sujin Kim (KASI) Jeong-Eun Lee (SNU) Nicha Leethochawalit (NARIT) Di Li (THU/NAOC) Aran Lyo (KASI) Takashi Miyata (U Tokyo) Jang Hyun Park (KASI) Jongho Park (KHU) Ue-Li Pen (ASIAA) Jubee Sohn (SNU) Masahiro Takada (U Tokyo) Masaomi Tanaka (Tohoku U) Matipon Tangmatitham (NARIT) Makoto Tashiro (Saitama U) Hsiang-Yi Karen Yang (NTHU) Ping Zhou (NJU) WeiWei Zhu (NAOC)\nDATE and VENUE: The EAMA11 will be held from December 8 to 12, 2025, at TOKI MESSE (Niigata Convention Center) in Niigata City, Niigata Prefecture, Japan.

Over the years, it has served as an important communication platform for the Taiwanese astronomy community through email and web announcements, earning recognition and support from the academic community.\nOn May 29, 2025, the management of TAN was transferred to the Astronomical Society of the Republic of China (ASROC), where it is now managed and maintained under unified oversight. In June of the same year, TAN was further integrated into the official website of ASROC (currently under testing), becoming one of the society’s key information dissemination platforms. It continues to serve the national astronomy community, enhancing the flow of academic information and resource sharing. Through TAN, researchers, teachers, and students can quickly access the latest domestic and international astronomy talks, summer schools, and academic activities, thereby promoting knowledge exchange and collaboration.\n","date":"31 May 2025","permalink":"/website/en/tan/history/","section":"Taiwan Astronomy Network","summary":"台灣天文網歷史的簡介","title":"A brief history of TAN"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/website/en/tags/history/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"History"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/website/en/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/website/en/tags/tan/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tan"},{"content":"Histroy of ASROC #本會最早於民國 11 年 10 月 30 日創立於北平，會址設於北京觀象臺，會長為高魯先生。 民國 47 年 2 月 14 日，受教育部高教司致函，由高平子、鄭子政、蔣丙然籌組恢復事宜。\n同年 3 月 10 日議決，遂在臺復會。\n第一次會員大會決議事項：\n以「中國天文學會」名義去函申請參加國際天文聯合會 (IAU) 訂定本會英文名稱：ASRC (The Astronomical Society of the Republic of China) 會址設於氣象所內 中國天文學會會員成立大會於民國 47 年 6 月 8 日 (14:00) 舉行，並選出第一屆理監事會成員：\n理事：\n高平子 (33)、蔣丙然 (32)、游彌堅 (20)、鄭子政 (18)、林榮安 (18)、蔡章獻 (16)、\n韓兆歧 (12)、戴運軌 (11)、方子衛 (10)\n後補：曹謨 (10)、薛鍾?
