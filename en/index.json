He works on N-body simulations of stellar clusters. I would like to invite you to take this chance to make his acquaintance if you are interested in related studies.\nBest regards, Yueh-Ning Lee, on behalf of CAG/NTNU #Venue: NTNU Gongguan campus S801\n*Speaker: *Frantisek Dinnbier (NCTS)\n*Title: *Open star clusters as live dynamical systems\nAbstract:\nMost if not all stars form in open star clusters or associations. Although open star clusters have been studied for more than a century, the high accuracy of Gaia mission opens a new window on these objects, discovering a large number of new open clusters as well as facilitating much better comparison with numerical models than previously possible. Shortly after their formation, massive stars terminate the star formation event by expelling the star forming gas. The rapid movement of the gaseous mass often has a strong impact on the dynamics of stars in the cluster. After gas expulsion, the cluster evolves mainly due to energy equipartition, mass segregation, stellar evaporation and ejection as well as the tidal field imposed by the Galaxy. From these dynamical processes, we will pay particular attention on two topics: gas expulsion, and dynamical evolution of orbital parameters of binary stars as they encounter other cluster members with emphasis on stars of spectral type B and Cepheids. We will discuss the properties of tidal tails forming around open star clusters as the consequence of early gas expulsion as well as of dynamical evaporation. We also suggest that the typical configuration for B star formation is likely in hierarchical triples, not binary stars as usually assumed.\n\u0026ndash; Yueh-Ning Lee Associate Professor, Department of Earth Sciences, National Taiwan Normal University https://www.es.ntnu.edu.tw/index.php/en/index_en/ Deputy Director, Center of Astronomy and Gravitation https://www.cag.ntnu.edu.tw/index.php/en/main/ Tel: +886-2-7749-6417 李悅寧 國立台灣師範大學 地球科學系 副教授 天文與重力中心 副主任\n","date":"4 July 2025","permalink":"/website/en/tan/tan-bot/2025_07_04_16_59_39-197d4aa3499e5dbb/","section":"Taiwan Astronomy Network","summary":"","title":"CAG/NTNU seminar 10/Jul/2025 12:20 S801"},{"content":"Dear colleagues,\nThis is a reminder of the EANAM10 meeting in Jeju Island:\nhttps://coma.kasi.re.kr/eanam10/\nThe registration deadline is July 31.

The workshop is scheduled to be held in the afternoon of Monday, June 23, at NTNU\u0026rsquo;s Gongguan Campus.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re welcome to spread the word about the workshop!\n================================= Planetary Atmospheres: how to simulate the composition of different worlds\nThe study of planetary atmospheres plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of planetary formation, evolution, and diversity. The chemical composition of an atmosphere preserves valuable information about a planet’s origin, surface and interior processes, and potential for habitability. As exoplanet observations rapidly expand and spectroscopic data become increasingly precise, the ability to model atmospheric chemistry with accuracy is essential for interpreting these observations and uncovering the physical conditions of distant worlds.\nIn this workshop, Dr. Shang-Min Tsai https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/people/cv_c.php?i=smtsai (ASIAA) will offer a comprehensive introduction to the principles and techniques of atmospheric chemical modeling. Participants will learn how to simulate atmospheric composition profiles under a range of physical conditions using the open-source VULCAN code https://github.com/exoclime/VULCAN developed by Dr. Tsai. Key topics include chemical kinetics, vertical mixing, boundary conditions, and customization of chemical networks. The workshop will feature hands-on examples covering hot Jupiters, Earth-like planets, and other planetary atmospheres. It is designed for students and researchers with interests in planetary science, exoplanetary atmospheres, atmospheric chemistry, and numerical modeling.

The previous meeting, EAMA10, was held in 2016, with subsequent gatherings postponed partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. EAMA11, the upcoming gathering hosted by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), will broaden its scope to encompass astronomical researchers across Asia and beyond, providing a valuable platform for researchers to reconnect, share ideas, and promote collaboration. We solicit talks on regional activities, current and upcoming large-scale facilities, recent scientific discoveries, astronomy education and public outreach.
