(https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20261109/) We expect approximately 100 participants to attend the conference. Please mark your calendar if you are interested in attending the conference,\nDisks around Class 0/I protostars represent the earliest stages of disk assembly, during which mass and angular momentum are still actively exchanged with the surrounding envelopes. These young disks are crucial for understanding how stars and planets form, as they set the initial conditions for subsequent disk evolution and potential early planet formation. Recent observations have revealed a wide diversity in physical and chemical properties of these embedded disks, including substructures and signs of dust evolution, some of which differ significantly from those seen in more evolved Class II disks. These findings suggest that key processes such as grain growth and planet formation may begin much earlier than previously thought. Establishing the link between these embedded disks and the more evolved Class II stage is therefore essential for building a continuous picture of disk evolution and the emergence of planetary systems. By bringing together new observations, theoretical models, and simulations, this conference aims to explore the physical and chemical processes that shape disks from their youngest phases onward.\nKey topics of the conference include:\nDisk formation and early evolution Dust properties and growth Disk physical structures and substructures Early planetesimal and planet formation Magnetic fields and angular momentum transport Accretion mechanisms and episodic accretion Disk chemistry from embedded to evolved stages SOC\nAnders Johansen (Globe Institute, University of Copenhagen / Lund University) Jes Jørgensen (Niels Bohr Institute, Denmark) Akimasa Kataoka (NAOJ, Japan) Nagayoshi Ohashi (ASIAA, Taiwan) John Tobin (NRAO, USA) Yusuke Tsukamoto (Kagoshima University, Japan) Coco Zhang (University of Wisconsin–Madison, USA) LOC\nCindy Chiu (ASIAA) Grace Huang (ASIAA) Shirley Huang (ASIAA) Patrick Koch (ASIAA) Tina Lin (ASIAA) Nagayoshi Ohashi (ASIAA) Hsi-Wei Yen (Chair: ASIAA) More details including the information on the registration will be announced in the 2nd circular.

Tracing the evolution of the ISM from the early universe to the present day is essential to understanding galaxy formation, chemical enrichment, star formation histories, and the emergence of habitable environments.\nRecent advances in both observations and numerical models – from JWST and ALMA to high-resolution simulations – now allow us to study the ISM across a wide range of epochs and environments. At the same time, the rapid development of artificial intelligence and machine learning is opening new avenues in numerical modeling, data analysis, and predictive simulations, enabling us to tackle the ISM’s complexity in unprecedented ways.\nThis Symposium aims to bring together experts in galactic and extragalactic ISM studies, star formation, astrochemistry, and cosmology to synthesize our current understanding and chart future directions.\nDiscussion topics Discussion will cover a range of topics, including: Low-metallicity ISM Extreme ISM environments Feedback and the ISM lifecycle Gaseous Environments Across Cosmic Epochs Dusty Environments Cosmic Rays, Magnetic Fields, and Turbulence in the ISM The ISM Across Cosmic Time: Observational Frontiers Numerical Models, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning\nInvited Speakers (list not yet complete) Alex Cameron (Oxford, UK) Emanuele Daddi (CEA, France) Christoph Federrath (Australian National University, Australia) Reinhard Genzel (MPE, Germany) Brett McGuire (MIT, USA) Kate Pattle (UCL, UK) Jerome Pety (IRAM, France) Julia Roman-Duval (STScI, USA) Jiayi Sun (Kentucky, USA) Linda Tacconi (MPE, Germany) Stefanie Walch-Gassner (Cologne, Germany)\nScientific Organizing Committee Thomas Bisbas (Zhejiang Lab, China; co-chair) Brandt Gaches (University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany; co-chair) Munan Gong (University of Texas at El Paso, USA) Kathryn Grasha (Australian National University, Australia) Francois Lique (Universite de Rennes, France) Desika Narayanan (University of Florida, USA) Hsi-An Pan (Tamkang University, Taiwan)\n","date":"6 January 2026","permalink":"/website/en/tan/tan-bot/2026_01_06_11_00_26-19b913fdc1bcdbca/","section":"Taiwan Astronomy Network","summary":"","title":"Olympian Symposium 2026 (18-22 May 2026, Paralia Katerini, Greece)"},{"content":"Mini-Worksop on High-Energy Cosmic Explosions\nNobel Laureate Series\nDate: 2026.01.20\nTime: 09:00am-11:40am,\nVenue: Art Center, 7F, Library, NCHU\n國立中興大學 圖書館, 7 樓, 藝術中心\n「宇宙正在說話——你準備好聽見它的聲音了嗎？」\n宇宙為什麼會「大爆炸」？這些現象又在悄悄告訴我們什麼？\n我們也將跟著諾貝爾獎得主 Brian Schmidt 教授，一起看看臺灣未來的望遠鏡計畫，如何帶領我們用全新的視角「看見宇宙」。\nThe Universe is not quiet—it is filled with spectacular explosions and flashes of energy.

We assume a hybrid style (face-to-face and online). We expect the conference to be a full three-day event.\nRegistration and hotel reservations (Howard Hotel near the venue) are now open. https://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/workshop/20260317/registration.php\nThe deadline for submitting a presentation (oral or poster) application and requesting hotel reservations is *** December 31st ***.\nThis deadline has been extended by about half a month from the #initial deadline (12/15).\nThe number of rooms the LOC can secure at the Howard Hotel is #limited. Therefore, submitting a hotel reservation request does not guarantee a room. Please be aware that, depending on the number of requests, you may be asked to share a room (especially students) or may need to arrange your own hotel.\nWe look forward to this conference being an excellent opportunity to share and discuss the latest research findings from Subaru PFS. We welcome presentations and ideas not only on AGN research using PFS/HSC, but also on galaxy/AGN science based on wide-field imaging/spectroscopic observations using instruments such as DESI, Euclid, Rubin/LSST, and Roman.\nBest regards, Yoshiki Toba on behalf of the SOC\nScientific rationale: #One of the most critical issues in astronomy and astrophysics today is to understand when and how supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have formed and evolved across cosmic history. The Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) has been mighty in this field, producing a variety of scientific results, from the host galaxies in the local universe to the most distant quasars. Additionally, once wide-area imaging/spectroscopic observations with Euclid, Rubin/LSST, and Roman become available, AGN science can be anticipated to advance, e.g., from statistical properties and rare population search. This conference aims to share our insights into the growth history of SMBHs, derived from HSC data (including both SSP and open-use), and to explore strategies for advancing the field\u0026rsquo;s heritage into the future. In particular, the science operation of the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) and PFS-SSP began in March 2025, providing millions of galaxy/AGN spectra in the future. Hence, this conference will be an excellent opportunity to share scientific results based on initial PFS (open-use/SSP) data and discuss the spectroscopic properties of AGN. We invite all researchers who are leading or interested in AGN studies based on wide-field survey data to this conference. Any AGN sciences/proposal presentation with those facilities is welcome.\nThe topics to be covered in the conference include (but are not limited to):\nAGN search with multi-wavelength/time-domain data Statistical properties of AGN/galaxies (e.g., luminosity function and correlation function) SMBH growth over cosmic time AGN host properties (e.g., morphology and AGN-SF connection) AGN/galaxy environment Any PFS-related topics Status of on-going AGN/galaxy projects and future prospects Invited speakers # Thaisa Storchi Bergmann (UFRGS) (remote) Ke-Jung Chen (ASIAA) Kohei Ichikawa (Tohoku Univ.)

In this work, we investigate the magnetic field morphology of the HD 163296 disk using archival ALMA 870 μm polarization data. Although polarization is often attributed to magnetically aligned dust grains, recent studies indicate that dust self-scattering can produce comparable or even dominant polarization signals. To separate these mechanisms, we apply two approaches: (1) assuming a uniform self-scattering polarization angle and subtracting its contribution from the observed Stokes parameters, and (2) modeling disk density and temperature structures and simulating self-scattering with RADMC-3D. The residual polarization is then interpreted as tracing the magnetic field. Our results show that self-scattering dominates the observed polarization, while the magnetic contribution is weak and difficult to isolate. These findings underscore the challenges of using dust polarization to probe disk magnetic fields and motivate future studies with improved modeling and broader source samples.\nOn Mon, Jul 14, 2025 at 11:41 AM Min-Kai Lin mklin@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw wrote:\nDear colleagues,\nThe NCTS Astrophysics group is resuming our monthly student seminar series.

From subsurface oceans and transient atmospheres to ancient river valleys and volcanic worlds, these diverse environments illustrate the processes that govern volatile evolution, climate stability, and orbital dynamics between planets, satellites, and host stars. At the same time, the discovery of thousands of exoplanets has expanded our view of planetary diversity, underscoring the need to interpret distant worlds through the lens of nearby analogs.\nThis session invites interdisciplinary contributions that explore the geophysical and astrophysical conditions of planets and satellites both within and beyond the Solar System. We welcome studies drawing on spacecraft missions, laboratory experiments, field analogs, and theoretical or numerical models. Topics may include volatile delivery and loss, dynamical interactions among planets, satellites, and their hosts, atmospheric and surface evolution, photochemistry and climate processes, geophysical activity, planetary spectra, or any related perspective that connects Solar System exploration with the broader context of exoplanets. By fostering dialogue across communities, this session seeks to highlight the shared frameworks that guide the search for habitable worlds, and the potential for life, throughout the cosmos.\nConvenors: Howard Chen (Florida Institute of Technology), Pin-Gao Gu (ASIAA),\nBetty Pei-Chun Tsai (Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research), Shang-Min Tsai (ASIAA), Xinting Yu (University of Texas at San Antonio)\n","date":"21 November 2025","permalink":"/website/en/tan/tan-bot/2025_11_21_14_38_39-19aa5232c6d88c32/","section":"Taiwan Astronomy Network","summary":"","title":"Call for Abstracts: AOGS 2026 solar system-exoplanet session"},{"content":"Dear colleagues,\nWe will have our monthly NCTS Astrophysics Student Lunch Seminars next Friday, 11/28, from 12pm in the 4F lecture room in the Cosmology Hall.

Most importantly, mergers have the potential to both rapidly enhance and then rapidly halt – or “quench” – star formation in the remnant. In this conference, we will bring together members of the astrophysical community studying the merger-driven rapid quenching of star formation in galaxies, from the nearby universe to high-redshift. We aim to address the following key questions:\nWhat are the main mechanisms for rapid quenching and what are its signatures? How is rapid quenching related to morphological change and the buildup of central black holes? What are the big open questions regarding the physics of rapid quenching? What is the influence of AGN throughout the quenching phase? What have we learned in the last several years (with e.g., JWST, ALMA, new cosmological simulations, etc.) and how will upcoming facilities progress our understanding of rapid galaxy quenching? The idea of this meeting is to bring together observers, with experience at all wavelengths, and theorists working on rapid quenching at any simulation scale. With a focus on discussion and model–observation comparison, we aim to identify the biggest open questions on how and why galaxies quench, and collaboratively discuss which areas are most critical for advancement.\n","date":"12 November 2025","permalink":"/website/en/tan/tan-bot/2025_11_12_08_52_25-19a758ce827711cf/","section":"Taiwan Astronomy Network","summary":"","title":"End of Star Formation Conference: abstract deadline extended to Nov. 22"},{"content":"Updated the attached files.\nTing-Wan Chen twchen@gm.astro.ncu.edu.tw 於 2025年11月11日 週二 上午12:53寫道：\nDear Colleagues,\nWe are pleased to announce the Call for Proposals for the LOT 2026A semester (January 1–April 30, 2026).

A century after Hubble’s discovery of cosmic expansion, our instruments have advanced dramatically. Through diverse probes—the cosmic microwave background (CMB), galaxy surveys, supernovae, and gravitational waves—the Universe’s history has become a subject of direct measurement rather than theory. Cosmology has entered a stage where precision observations open new physics, and at its frontier lies the search for the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). Within the next five years, two landmark discoveries may be within reach: (1) primordial gravitational waves from inflation or cosmological phase transitions; and (2) an astrophysical SGWB from compact binary mergers across cosmic time. These goals unite cosmology and gravitational-wave astronomy, driving international efforts such as LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA and the Simons Observatory toward the next breakthrough. In this mini-workshop, we explore the combined impact of GW and CMB observations on the emerging Gravitational-Wave Landscape, the cosmology and astrophysics they enable, and new ideas for cross-correlations with other probes.\nConfirmed speakers: • Yi-Kuan Chiang (ASIAA) • Yuji Chinone (KEK) • Shouvik Roy Choudhury (ASIAA) • Giacomo Galloni (Ferrara) • Tomo Goto (NTHU) • Colin Hill (Columbia) • Yuki Inoue (NCU, ASIoP) • Daiki Tanabe (ASIoP) • Keiichi Umetsu (ASIAA) • Viona Wei (NCU) • More to be announced\u0026hellip;\n","date":"29 October 2025","permalink":"/website/en/tan/tan-bot/2025_10_29_19_00_20-19a2fa0d0250ed29/","section":"Taiwan Astronomy Network","summary":"","title":"Fwd: GW-CMB 2025 Workshop New Frontiers in Observational Cosmology with Gravitational Waves and Cosmic Microwave Background"},{"content":"Dear colleagues,\nWe will have our monthly NCTS Astrophysics Student Lunch Seminars next Friday, 10/31, from 12pm in the 4F lecture room in the Cosmology Hall.

Investigating Gas Dynamics in Cool-core Galaxy ClustersYi-Yang Lee (NTHU, supervisor: Hsiang-Yi Karen Yang) Intracluster medium (ICM, or hot gas) with strong X-ray emissions and cold gas (T~10^4K) nebular gas with optical emissions interact with each other at the central regions of some cool-core galaxy clusters; this interaction plays a crucial role in the cluster evolution. We aim at comparing the gas kinematic between the observations of cool-core clusters and our simulations in order to interpret the dynamical properties of cold and hot gas in clusters. Hydrodynamic simulations with two different scenarios of cold gas properties, modeled as “Brick” or “Mist”, are performed to trace their kinematics. By calculating the cold gas time-averaged line-of-sight velocity, velocity dispersion and comparing observed values, we found the observations do not have a clear preference on Brick-like or Mist-like cold gas. On the other hand, recent XRISM observations of the hot gas prefer the predicted values from the Brick simulation, indicating the cold gas is likely to be dense, clumpy gas rather than misty, tiny cloudlets that passively floating within the cluster.\n2. Transit Timing Constraints on the Maximum Exomoon Mass Prangsutip Cherdwongsung (NTHU, supervisor: Ing-Guey Jiang)\nThe search for exomoons, moons orbiting exoplanets, is one of the most exciting challenges. This study investigates the use of transit timing variations (TTV) and transit duration variations (TDV) as indirect methods to detect potential exomoons. By analyzing periodic shifts in transit mid-times and durations from the synthetic light curves that include TESS-like noise, we aim to identify the dynamical signatures that indicate the gravitational influence of an orbiting moon. Our current focus is the WASP-31b system, which exhibits unusually strong sodium (Na I) and potassium (K I) absorption features that may originate from volcanic activity on unseen exomoons, as proposed by Oza et al. (2019). We estimate the maximum exomoon mass that can remain dynamically stable within this system. These results help assess the plausibility of exomoons around hot Jupiters and guide future observations to confirm their presence.\n\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;- Forwarded message \u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash; From: Min-Kai Lin mklin@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw Date: Mon, Jul 14, 2025 at 11:41 AM Subject: NCTS Astrophysics Student Lunch Seminars [July to December 2025] To: riaa riaa@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw, ncts-tca-all@googlegroups.com, \u0026lt; tan@asroc.org.tw\u0026gt;\nDear colleagues,\nThe NCTS Astrophysics group is resuming our monthly student seminar series.

From Simulations to Spectra: Investigating AGN Wind-Disk Interactions and Asymmetric Galactic Outflows *\nChiung-Yin Chan (NTHU, supervisor: Karen Yang)\nWe use 3D special relativistic hydrodynamic (SRHD) simulations to study AGN-driven winds in a disk galaxy. Our results reveal an early-stage (t ~ 0.1 Myr) asymmetry in bubble formation, with one bubble reaching velocities up to 2000 km/s while the other remains underdeveloped due to interactions with the clumpy disk. This aligns with JWST observations of NGC 7469, which show a circumnuclear starburst ring and one-sided high-velocity outflows. To explore observational signatures, we generate mock spectra using TRIDENT, finding that the asymmetry is detectable in the [NeV] line at optical wavelengths, as TRIDENT produces spectra comparable to HST rather than JWST. Phase diagrams suggest that matching observed emission requires the disk density in our simulations to be at least an order of magnitude lower. These findings provide insight into AGN wind-disk interactions and offer a potential explanation for the asymmetric outflows in NGC 7469.\n2. Irradiation Bias in Dynamical Mass Determination\nHuan-Ping Chao (NCKU, supervisor: Kwan-Lok Li)\nWe have developed a Python tool to simulate the optical observations of tidally locked companions in compact binary systems, based on the Roche potential and the Göttingen spectral library. The tool generates phase-resolved spectra from arbitrary viewing angles. With these simulations, we investigate the impact of irradiation on the observed center of light and assess the resulting biases in dynamical mass measurements of the compact primary. For a system analogous to PSR J0952−0607, our results show that irradiation shifts the center of light inward, reducing its effective radius by about 6.3% compared to a non-irradiated model. This bias indicates that fitting observations of irradiated systems with non-irradiated models systematically underestimates the mass of the compact primary.

Please forward the following information to other colleagues/postdocs/students.\nThere is a special symposium at the American Chemical Society 2026 meeting in Atlanta on the icy universe. I was asked to pass along this flyer and information by the organizers.\nThe symposium focuses on astrochemistry during star and planet formation. In particular, the ice (and gas) observations by JWST. The summary is shown below.\nPlease pass it along to those who are interested in this session and ask them to submit an abstract. The abstract submission deadline is September 29.\nSummary The origin of life on Earth remains one of the most significant and unresolved \u0026ldquo;Grand Challenges\u0026rdquo; in science. Recent advancements in modern observatories, coupled with progress in astrochemical modeling and laboratory experiments, have revealed that complex organic molecules (COMs), including prebiotic species, are abundantly formed in both the interstellar medium (ISM) and the Solar System. Throughout the star-formation process, a dynamic interplay exists between gas-phase species and solid-phase molecules frozen on the surfaces of interstellar dust particles. Current understanding suggests that COMs are primarily synthesized in the solid phase and can transition to the gas phase via thermal and non-thermal desorption mechanisms. The intricate chemical complexity observed in star-forming regions serves as the foundational material for future exoplanetary systems. Despite this, our knowledge of these organic molecules within interstellar ices and their physicochemical evolution in space remains limited. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its unparalleled resolution and sensitivity in the near- to mid-infrared spectral range, has revolutionized our understanding of the Universe. It has provided unprecedented insights into the early stages of star formation, capturing detailed observations of protostars and protoplanetary disks. The JWST has enabled the first direct detection of COMs in ices during early protostellar phases, advanced the study of exoplanetary atmospheres, and delivered remarkable imaging of our Solar System. The timing of this symposium is particularly relevant, as by spring 2026, JWST will have nearly completed its Cycle 4 observations across its full suite of instruments. This gathering will celebrate the groundbreaking scientific discoveries facilitated by JWST in recent years. With a strong emphasis on the interdisciplinary field of astrochemistry—including laboratory research, theoretical modeling, and observations of the ISM, from diffuse regions to dense molecular clouds, protostars, protoplanetary disks, and our Solar System—this symposium aims to engage a broad audience of chemists and (planetary) astronomers, fostering collaboration and innovation at the Atlanta meeting.\nProposed Session Topics (not necessarily in this order):\nHighly irradiated environments (PDRs, high-mass star-forming regions).\rMolecular clouds.\rProtostars.\rProtoplanetary disk ice.\rProtoplanetary disk gas / pebble transport.\rSolar System.\rThank you!\nRegards, Daniel\nDaniel Harsono\nAssociate Professor Institute of Astronomy National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan R.

Additionally, once wide-area imaging/spectroscopic observations with Euclid, Rubin/LSST, and Roman become available, AGN science can be anticipated to advance, e.g., from statistical properties and rare population search. This conference aims to share our insights into the growth history of SMBHs, derived from HSC data (including both SSP and open-use), and to explore strategies for advancing the field\u0026rsquo;s heritage into the future. In particular, the science operation of the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) and PFS-SSP began in March 2025, providing millions of galaxy/AGN spectra in the future. Hence, this conference will be an excellent opportunity to share scientific results based on initial PFS (open-use/SSP) data and discuss the spectroscopic properties of AGN.

Model the streamer Structure in Collapsing Prestellar Cores.\nTsung-Han Chuang (NTNU)\nStreamers have been observed with high-resolution ALMA observations around many protoplanetary disks undergoing formation. They have been suggested to dominate the mass accretion budget from the collapsing prestellar core, and have important consequences on the disk dynamics. Understanding the formation of streamers is therefore important for explaining how protoplanetary disks receive mass from the envelope. We propose a model to explain the formation of streamer structures by considering density enhancements due to gravitational instability. We test our model against sources where streamers have been detected (ex. Per-emb-2 and Per-emb-50 observed with NOEMA) and fit for model parameters. This allows us to gain deeper insights into the physical origin of streamers and their role in mass transport from the core to the disk. This model can be applied to analyze new observations as well as archival data that show signs of streamers.\n2. A Rotation Dip in the Envelope-Disk Transition Region: Evidence of Magnetic Braking\nJyun-Heng Lin (NTHU/ASIAA)\nThe envelope-disk transition region in protostellar system is key to understanding how angular momentum is removed during star formation. Magnetic braking, predicted to operate in this region, can remove angular momentum and regulate disk growth, but direct observational evidence remains limited. Using ALMA C18O (J = 2–1) data of the HH 111 VLA1 system, we analyzed gas kinematics within 6000 au of the protostar. We find clear deviations from simple free-fall with conserved angular momentum across the transition region (~5200–160 au), which can be divided into three zones: (1) an outer region with reduced infall velocity, likely due to magnetic tension from pinched field lines; (2) a middle region showing a sharp drop in rotation velocity and angular momentum, consistent with strong magnetic braking; and (3) an inner region where rotation rises toward Keplerian velocity and infall ceases, likely due to weaker braking from ambipolar diffusion. The resulting dip in the rotation profile provides observational evidence for magnetic braking.\n","date":"18 August 2025","permalink":"/website/en/tan/tan-bot/2025_08_18_08_00_00-198ba7a08d8c0edb/","section":"Taiwan Astronomy Network","summary":"","title":"Re: NCTS Astrophysics Student Lunch Seminars [July to December 2025]"},{"content":"Dear Colleagues:\nThe cross-strait conference on particle physics and cosmology, after being suspended in 2019, will be resumed this year.

Simulations consistently suggest that such interactions significantly reshape the distribution of molecular gas within galactic disks, thereby altering the spatial distribution of star formation. In this study, we aim to observationally investigate the distribution of gas and star formation across different merger stages and assess the extent to which these observations align with simulation predictions. Here we analyze a sample of 15 galaxies—including galaxy pairs and post-mergers—with stellar masses log(M*) ≥ 10 [M⊙] and redshifts in the range 0.02 \u0026lt; z \u0026lt; 0.1, using data from ALMA and SDSS-MaNGA. We also construct radial profiles of gas fraction, star formation rate(SFR), and star formation efficiency(SFE), extending from the galactic center to 1.5 effective radii(Re). Our results indicate that the gas fraction is the primary driver of elevated SFR in close pair systems. Nevertheless, all merger stages exhibit an inconsistent relationship between SFR and gas mass, suggesting the presence of a common regulatory mechanism governing star formation during galaxy interactions.\nOn Mon, Jul 14, 2025 at 11:41 AM Min-Kai Lin mklin@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw wrote:\nDear colleagues,\nThe NCTS Astrophysics group is resuming our monthly student seminar series.

This first joint seminar is part of the monthly Large Submillimeter Telescope (LST) Seminar series in Japan, which began in November 2021.\nThe seminar aims to foster discussion on various research directions for current and future single-dish telescopes and to strengthen collaboration among researchers in the field. As a reminder, the next seminar will be held this Thursday, July 10th. We are pleased to share the presentation title from our speaker, Yao-Lun Yang (RIKEN), and the Zoom access information below. Please feel free to forward this email to anyone who might be interested.\nThe 1st Japan-Taiwan Joint Seminar on Single-Dish mm/Submm Telescope Studies (The 25th LST Seminar)\n2025 July 10th, Thursday Taiwan 15:30 — 17:00 = JST 16:30-18:00\nDr. Yao-Lun Yang (RIKEN, Japan)\r“PRIMA: Future of Far-Infrared Astronomy for Star Formation”\nUnderstanding the origin of solar-type planetary systems remains one of the fundamental questions in astronomy. These systems form within dense, dusty clouds, where high extinction presents a significant challenge for direct observational studies of the physical and chemical processes at the onset of star and planet formation. Over the past decades, most studies have relied on submillimeter and millimeter interferometric observations \u0026mdash; primarily using ALMA \u0026mdash; to probe the cold dust and gas (~10–100 K), helping to constrain the structures and chemistry of planet-forming disks. More recently, the JWST has enabled unprecedented sensitivity at mid-infrared wavelengths, allowing us to characterize hot gas and dust (\u0026gt;1000 K). However, the bulk of the energy emitted by protostars and protoplanetary disks lies in the far-infrared regime (100–1000 K) \u0026mdash; a spectral window that was once accessible through missions such as ISO, AKARI, SOFIA, and Herschel, but is no longer covered by current observatories. The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) is a proposed mission designed to uniquely fill this observational gap.\nPRIMA aims to probe the dominant components of gas and dust in star-forming regions, with a particular focus on protostellar and protoplanetary systems. In this talk, I will introduce the PRIMA mission concept and the efforts currently led by the Japanese astronomical community. I will also present several key science cases in star formation that PRIMA’s 24–235 μm imaging and spectroscopic capabilities can uniquely address. Additionally, I will highlight the synergy between PRIMA and the LST. Finally, I will share opportunities for researchers to get involved in the PRIMA project and contribute to its scientific goals.\nZoom Link https://us06web.zoom.us/j/86216241378?pwd=fQ1eMhhQVofVS0OKQ1W8DdysmNUiZl.1 Organizers Chian-Chou CHEN (ASIAA, Taiwan), Ray S.

He works on N-body simulations of stellar clusters.

Although open star clusters have been studied for more than a century, the high accuracy of Gaia mission opens a new window on these objects, discovering a large number of new open clusters as well as facilitating much better comparison with numerical models than previously possible. Shortly after their formation, massive stars terminate the star formation event by expelling the star forming gas. The rapid movement of the gaseous mass often has a strong impact on the dynamics of stars in the cluster. After gas expulsion, the cluster evolves mainly due to energy equipartition, mass segregation, stellar evaporation and ejection as well as the tidal field imposed by the Galaxy. From these dynamical processes, we will pay particular attention on two topics: gas expulsion, and dynamical evolution of orbital parameters of binary stars as they encounter other cluster members with emphasis on stars of spectral type B and Cepheids. We will discuss the properties of tidal tails forming around open star clusters as the consequence of early gas expulsion as well as of dynamical evaporation. We also suggest that the typical configuration for B star formation is likely in hierarchical triples, not binary stars as usually assumed.\n\u0026ndash; Yueh-Ning Lee Associate Professor, Department of Earth Sciences, National Taiwan Normal University https://www.es.ntnu.edu.tw/index.php/en/index_en/ Deputy Director, Center of Astronomy and Gravitation https://www.cag.ntnu.edu.tw/index.php/en/main/ Tel: +886-2-7749-6417 李悅寧 國立台灣師範大學 地球科學系 副教授 天文與重力中心 副主任\n","date":"4 July 2025","permalink":"/website/en/tan/tan-bot/2025_07_04_16_59_39-197d4aa3499e5dbb/","section":"Taiwan Astronomy Network","summary":"","title":"CAG/NTNU seminar 10/Jul/2025 12:20 S801"},{"content":"Dear colleagues,\nThis is a reminder of the EANAM10 meeting in Jeju Island:\nhttps://coma.kasi.re.kr/eanam10/\nThe registration deadline is July 31.

The chemical composition of an atmosphere preserves valuable information about a planet’s origin, surface and interior processes, and potential for habitability. As exoplanet observations rapidly expand and spectroscopic data become increasingly precise, the ability to model atmospheric chemistry with accuracy is essential for interpreting these observations and uncovering the physical conditions of distant worlds.\nIn this workshop, Dr. Shang-Min Tsai https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/people/cv_c.php?i=smtsai (ASIAA) will offer a comprehensive introduction to the principles and techniques of atmospheric chemical modeling. Participants will learn how to simulate atmospheric composition profiles under a range of physical conditions using the open-source VULCAN code https://github.com/exoclime/VULCAN developed by Dr. Tsai. Key topics include chemical kinetics, vertical mixing, boundary conditions, and customization of chemical networks. The workshop will feature hands-on examples covering hot Jupiters, Earth-like planets, and other planetary atmospheres.
